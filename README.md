Hi, please read the below to gain a better understanding of my project
Note this is still in development

This project is a blogsite created using Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS and JS. The aim of the project is to allow users to post blog posts and dynamically update the page with the post. 
There are various functionality included such as searching, filtering, login/signin.

The website is also responsive and will use local storage to save some information. MOst of the website works locally and saves information only for each web session.

To imporvew on the project we can implement postgreSQWL to save the information for extended periods, this will be implemented in the future.

Thank you for looking at my project if there are any improvements or suggestion, please let me know.
